# audio-transcriber
Transcribes audio files to a WordPress post.

Configuration guide: in order for this WordPress plugin to work you must provide a valid API key in the audio-transcriber.php file.
This can be done on line 83 $apiKey = 'KEY'; After you have entered a valid API key you can then make a compressed zip containing
these three files. You will be able to install this plugin directly into your WordPress plugins and it will be ready to go. 

Demo: You will be prompted with 3 required input fields.
The first input field requires you to select the audio file that you wish to transcribe.
The second input field requires you enter a title for the post you wish to make.
The third input field requires you to select a post category where youd like the post to be made in.
